# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core value:** Each audience at Marsh receives only the intelligence relevant to their decisions, priority-ranked and AI-summarised, delivered daily with zero manual effort.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Vertical Slice Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Vertical Slice Foundation)
Plan: 1 of 5 complete (01-01: project-scaffolding)
Status: In progress - ready for Plan 01-02
Last activity: 2026-02-06 — Completed 01-01-PLAN.md (project scaffolding)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 20% (Phase 1: 1/5 plans complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 3 minutes
- Total execution time: 0.05 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 1/5 | 3 min | 3 min |

**Recent Trend:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Tabs implementation**: Phase 1 uses JavaScript tabs for browser viewing (served via FastAPI endpoint). Phase 5 will handle email delivery separately (email clients don't support JS). This is the correct approach — no premature email optimization.
- **Test source**: Reinsurance News selected for Phase 1 vertical slice (clean structured data, reliable daily updates).
- **Multi-role article schema** (01-01): Using JSON text column for roles array instead of M2M table. Simpler for Phase 1, may need migration later.
- **Port 8001** (01-01): MDInsights runs on 8001 to avoid conflict with BrasilIntel on 8000 during parallel development.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1:**
- Requires Azure AD app registration for Azure OpenAI and Microsoft Graph API access
- Requires Apify account setup and actor configuration
- Requires prototype HTML from RefChyt/prototype_daily_intelligence_brief.html as reference

**Phase 2:**
- Need to identify and validate all 18+ target sources from prototype
- Apify rate limiting and cost implications need validation during scale-up

**Phase 4:**
- Report format clarification: REPT-01 specifies single HTML with tabs, but PROJECT.md mentions "separate emails per role" — roadmap follows REPT-01 (tabbed brief, single email)
